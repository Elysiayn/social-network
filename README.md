## Usage
- Once server has been initialized by running 'npm start' in root directory of terminal:
- API routes can be tested on servers. As this is a back-end ONLY application, there will be no front end to display results. 
Instead, user will need to utilize an API test client to test out the API routes located in routes/api folder. 
- Developer utilized [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) as the API test client. 
- Please review video of application [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mb6I6CaAwc&ab_channel=Elysiayn).

## Features
